## Introduction

This post aims to share with you how to import a text document into R and at the same time extracting each row into column of a data.frame.

Screenshot below show how the original text document look like.

In this post, we are going to learn how to extract the text and capture them into columns look similar to the screenshot below

## Getting Started

### Installing and launching R Packages

Two R packages from the tidyverse family will be used to accomplish the task, they are: [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) and [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/). 

The code chunk below will be used install and launch the packages in RStudio.

```{r}
packages = c('stringr', 'tidyr')
for (p in packages){
if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
install.packages(p)
}
library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

### Tidying the text document

Before getting start, it will be wiser to tidy the text document as shown below

The main changes are as follows:

- Remove all the empty lines between two sentences.
- Add "AUTHOR:" in front of the author name.
- Keep author name as a separated line.
- For **Text:** line, edit the multiple sentences into a single paragraph. 

Now, we are ready to import the text file into R.

## Reading a text file into R

First, [**lapply()**](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/lapply) of Base R is used to import the text document (i.e. 77.txt) into R as a list object called *textlist*.

```{r}
textlist <- lapply("data/77.txt", readLines)
```

The code chunk below can be used to check the newly created object. 

```{r}
textlist
```

## Converting each element of the list into a data.frame

The code chunk below is used to convert each element in the newly created list into data.frame.  The output will replaced the initial *textlist* object. 

```{r}
textlist <- lapply(1:length(textlist),
                   function(i) data.frame(
                          caseno=i,
                          rawdata=textlist[[i]],
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

You can examine the structure of textlist object by click on it's name on the Data display panel.

Notice that the object is a data.frame consisting 2 columns and 6 rows as shown in the figure below.

## Binding these into a single data frame

The code chunk below will be used to bind the list object into a data.frame. 

```{r}
df <- do.call(rbind, textlist)
```

##  Spliting the rawdata column 

The code chunk below is then used to split the *rawdata* column into two columns at the first ':'.  Two functions of **stringr** package, namely: [str_trim()](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_trim.html) and [str_split_fixed()](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html) are used to complete the task.     

```{r}
df[,c("type","entry")] <- str_trim(str_split_fixed(df$rawdata,":",2))
```

Notice that the newly created two columns are called *type* and *entry* as shown in the screenshot below

## Transposing from 'long' to 'wide' format 

Lastly, the [pivot_wider()](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html) of tidyr package will be used to transpose the two columns into multiple columns data.frame as shown in the screenshot below.

```{r}
df <- df[,c("caseno","type","entry")]
df <- pivot_wider(df,
                  names_from = type,
                  values_from = entry)
```
