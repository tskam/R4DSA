Congratulations! Your first web blog has been built successfully.

Let us examine the Files window of RStudio as shown in the screenshot below.  The home-directory is called *R4DSA*.  It consists of the *R4DSA.rproj* file, the *about.rmd* file, the *index.rmd* file, the *_site.yml* file and two folders: *_posts* and *_site*.


![](img/image06.jpg)

Notice that the *about.rmd* and *index.rmd* are located at the home-directory.  On the other hand, the *welcome.rmd* is located at *R4DSA/_posts/welcome* sub-directory as shown in the screenshot below. 

The *_posts* folder contains all the R Markdown files we will use to create the blog posts.

The *_site* folder contains all the final html files and other libraries required to build the web page

The _site.yml is where we control the content of the blog that include the name, title, descriptive, and the navigation bars.

To update the change, the code chunk below should be used.

```{r}
rmarkdown::render_site()
