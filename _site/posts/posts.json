how to import a text document into R and at the same time extracting each row into column of a data.frame.\r\nScreenshot below show how the original text document look like.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we are going to learn how to extract the text and capture them into columns look similar to the screenshot below\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\nInstalling and launching R Packages\r\nTwo R packages from the tidyverse family will be used to accomplish the task, they are: stringr and tidyr.\r\nThe code chunk below will be used install and launch the packages in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('stringr', 'tidyr')\r\nfor (p in packages){\r\nif(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\ninstall.packages(p)\r\n}\r\nlibrary(p,character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTidying the text document\r\nBefore getting start, it will be wiser to tidy the text document as shown below\r\n\r\nThe main changes are as follows:\r\nRemove all the empty lines between two sentences.\r\nAdd “AUTHOR:” in front of the author name.\r\nKeep author name as a separated line.\r\nFor Text: line, edit the multiple sentences into a single paragraph.\r\nNow, we are ready to import the text file into R.\r\nReading a text file into R\r\nFirst, lapply() of Base R is used to import the text document (i.e. 77.txt) into R as a list object called textlist.\r\n\r\n\r\ntextlist <- lapply(\"data/77.txt\", readLines)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunk below can be used to check the newly created object.\r\n\r\n\r\ntextlist\r\n\r\n\r\n[[1]]\r\n[1] \"SOURCE: All News Today\"

\"TEXT: Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  Kraft had reached an agreement with the government that charges would be reduced and the Karel be released pending a trial, but Karel died two days before he was to go free. Questions linger, however, about the manner of Karel's death.  Requests for information were met with assurances that the police,  whose custody Karel was in at the time of his death, would do everything possible to perform an exhaustive investigation.  After Karel's body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karel's death stating that \\\"we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.\\\" As reported at the time of Karel's death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karel's body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police. Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karel's death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence. Yesterday on the morning of June 19th, a small group of POK supporters gathered in front of the Abila Police Station, holding photographs of Elian, and of another young martyr, Juliana Vann, the ten-year old girl who died in 1998 from cancer caused by benzene toxins in her drinking water. \\\"Both of them died because of government lies and corruption,\\\" one man told me who asked that his name be withheld because of concerns of police retaliation.  \\\"Juliana died because Kronos allowed GAStech to poison our water, and Elian died because he tried to bring Juliana justice.\\\"\"\r\n\r\nConverting each element of the list into a data.frame\r\nThe code chunk below is used to convert each element in the newly created list into data.frame. The output will replaced the initial textlist object.\r\n\r\n\r\ntextlist <- lapply(1:length(textlist),\r\n                   function(i) data.frame(\r\n                          caseno=i,\r\n                          rawdata=textlist[[i]],\r\n                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can examine the structure of textlist object by click on it’s name on the Data display panel.\r\n\r\nNotice that the object is a data.frame consisting 2 columns and 6 rows as shown in the figure below.\r\n\r\nBinding these into a single data frame\r\nThe code chunk below will be used to bind the list object into a data.frame.\r\n\r\n\r\ndf <- do.call(rbind, textlist)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpliting the rawdata column\r\nThe code chunk below is then used to split the rawdata column into two columns at the first ‘:’.

The first method is by using gh_whoami() of gh package. Alternatively, git_sitrep() of usethis package can be used too.\r\nUsing gh_whoami()\r\nAt RStudio Console, type the command below and press Enter key.\r\n\r\n\r\ngh::gh_whoami()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you already have a PAT, your Console window should look similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you do not have to continue the remaining steps.\r\nIf no PAT information are revealed, you will move on to next step to put your PAT into the Git credential store.\r\nUsing git_sitrep()\r\nAt RStudio Console, type the command below and press Enter key.\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::git_sitrep()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you already have a PAT, your Console window should look similar to the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nNote: The above is an subset of the complete list display on the screen.\r\nGet a personal access token (PAT)\r\nAfter checking the PAT information in your machine, you are ready to fix the problem.\r\nFirstly, we need to get a PAT by typing the command below on RStudio Console followed by pressing the Enter key.\r\n\r\n\r\nusethis::create_github_token()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssuming you’re signed into GitHub, create_github_token() takes you to a pre-filled form to create a new PAT.\r\nScroll all the way down the page and click on Generate token button.\r\nCopy the PAT to the clipboard (i.e. Ctrl-C).\r\nIt is a good practice to store the PAT in a file.\r\nPut the PAT into the Git credential store\r\nBefore we move on, we assume that you have the PAT available on the clipboard of your computer.\r\nAt RStudio Console, type the command below.\r\n\r\n\r\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a PAT stored already, it will prompt you to enter your PAT.\r\nPaste the PAT on it (i.e. Ctrol-V).\r\nIf you do already have a stored credential, gitcreds::gitcreds_set() reveals this and will even let you inspect it as shown in the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nThis helps you decide whether to keep the existing credential or replace it. When in doubt, embrace a new, known-to-be-good credential over an old one, of uncertain origins.\r\nTo confirm if the PAT have been stored correctly in your machine, you can repeat the step given on Checking the Credential section of this tutorial.\r\nReferences\r\nManaging Personal Access Tokens of gh package.\r\nManaging Git(Hub) Credentials of usethis package.\r\nChapter 10 Cache credentials for HTTPS of Happy Git and GitHub for the useR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
